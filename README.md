# 🌍 Geospatial and Water Quality Analysis of the Godavari River

This project focuses on analyzing satellite imagery to assess **residue levels** and **water quality trends** of the **Godavari River**, leveraging geospatial techniques and Python-based tools. It contributes to understanding environmental changes and pollution-prone zones using remote sensing and spectral band processing.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze residue distribution in the Godavari River using satellite imagery.
- Apply **spectral band analysis** and **NDWI** to monitor water quality.
- Identify potential **pollution hotspots** along the river course.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:
  - `Rasterio` – for handling geospatial raster data  
  - `NumPy` – for numerical processing  
  - `Matplotlib` – for data visualization  
  - `Pandas` – for structured data handling  
  - `OS`, `Glob` – for file handling  

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  
- **Data Source**: Satellite imagery in `.tiff` format (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel)

## 🧪 Concepts Used

- **Remote Sensing**
- **Spectral Band Analysis**
- **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)**
- **Geospatial Data Processing**
- **Environmental Monitoring**

---

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded and managed multi-band `.tiff` satellite images
   - Extracted relevant bands (e.g., B3, B5)

2. **NDWI Calculation**  
   - Formula: NDWI = (Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)  
   - Highlighted water bodies and helped assess changes in water quality

3. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted images to observe residue buildup, water spread, and vegetation
   - Created comparative plots for spatial analysis

---

## ✅ Results

- Successfully visualized **NDWI maps** showing water-heavy and residue-rich areas.
- Identified **possible pollution-prone zones** in the river basin.
- Enabled **visual monitoring** of water health using remote sensing data.
- Demonstrated a replicable process for **environmental impact studies** using open-source tools.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Integrate **temporal analysis** using satellite imagery from multiple months/years.
- Include other indices like **Turbidity Index** or **Chlorophyll Index** for detailed pollution mapping.
- Build a simple **dashboard or web app** to make the tool accessible to non-technical users (e.g., policy makers or environmental NGOs).
- Use **cloud computing platforms** like Google Earth Engine for large-scale processing.
